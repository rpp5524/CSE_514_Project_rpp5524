# Routing Algorithms Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates various routing algorithms for the CSE 514 Final Project, focusing on implementation, optimization and comparing the efficiency and accuracy of algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and A* in different network scenarios.

## Structure


## Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path for graphs with non-negative weights.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Shortest path even with negative weights.
- **Algorithms**: Optimized implementations on different topologies.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- more (yet to be decided)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHub/CSE514_RoutingAlgorithms.git
cd CSE_514_rpp5524
```

## Analysis
For detailed results, see the final project report in the docs directory.
